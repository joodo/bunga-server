1
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,400
什么?
What?

2
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,420
希望渺茫?
A long shot?

3
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,960
这个比赛吗?
This race?

4
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,690
不能错过?
Can't miss?

5
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,490
谢谢你,宝贝。
Thanks, baby.

6
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,930
从零用现金中拿出两根胡萝卜。
Take two carrots out of petty cash.

7
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:26,600
我和你核对一下。
I'll check with you.

8
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,100
来吧，孩子。
Come on, kid.

9
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,250
我们走吧。
Let's go.

10
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,750
为什么?
Why?

11
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,470
我在做什么?
What am I doing?

12
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,390
兜售了。
Touting again.

13
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,150
吹捧吗?
Touting?

14
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,710
他吗?
Him?

15
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,330
听着，孩子。
Now, listen, kid.

16
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,120
我们看到你用了很多疯狂的方法。
We've seen you use some pretty wild schemes.

17
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,620
为什么?
Why?

18
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,220
这匹马碰巧喜欢吃柠檬汁，这是一种罪过吗?
Is it a crime this horse happens to have A sweet tooth for lemon drops?

19
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,760
是啊，但你用这个对付那些疯狂的赛马玩家，他们会认为这匹马是在给你小费。
Yeah, but you're using this on these crazy horse players, They'll think the horse is giving you a tip.

20
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,130
你知道，我知道，这匹马也知道。
Well, you know it and I know it and the horse knows it.

21
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,350
但在法庭上听起来会很奇怪。
But it'll sound very peculiar in court.

22
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,420
你就出格一次，小子。
Just step out of line once, Kid.

23
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,530
手铐已经准备好了。
The handcuffs are ready.

24
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,340
别再烦我了，好吗?
Lay off me, will you?

25
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,140
如果幸运的话，我会给你买加水的冰块。
And if I get lucky, I'll buy you some ice with waters.

26
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,410
回想一下，就在上周四，我接受了他的一条建议。
To think just last Thursday, I went for one of his tips.

27
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,980
你也吗?
You, too?

28
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,950
我告诉你，乔治，我预感到肉馅饼会出事。
I tell you, George, I've got a hunch on Mince Pie.

29
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,940
记得那次你吃了那个女人的派，第二天你就不能去上班了，因为你生病了?
Remember that time you ate that woman's pie, And you couldn't go to work the next day because you were sick?

30
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,320
办公室被闪电击中了。
And the office was struck by lightning.

31
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,760
艾伦，那匹马不会因为名字叫肉馅饼就跑得更快的。
Ellen, that horse isn't going to run any faster Just because its name is Mince Pie.

32
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,190
肉馅饼三岁时表现不错。
Mince Pie is a pretty good three-year-old.

33
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,430
会赢得很多比赛。
Going to win a lot of races.

34
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,850
也就是说，如果它的腿康复了。
That is, if its leg gets well.

35
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,890
你……你觉得他的腿有问题吗?
You... you think there's something wrong with his leg?

36
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,980
觉得呢?
Think?

37
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,420
我是田径兽医。
I'm the track vet.

38
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:29,630
这是"阴道前"感染在"联邦"区域，这…哦，韧带发炎了。
It's a "precastinary" infection of the "fedasorial" area, Which... oh, inflamed ligaments.

39
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,960
想象一下，让一条坏腿的马去比赛。
Imagine allowing a horse to race with a bad leg.

40
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,800
一半的马都该坐轮椅。
Half of these horses should be in wheelchairs.

41
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,560
这是他们抢栏杆的唯一原因，这让他们有了依靠。
It's the only reason they fight for the rail, It gives them something to lean on.

42
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,860
你相信吗，比赛中只有一匹健康的马?
Would you believe it, there's only one Sound horse in the race?

43
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,500
医生吗?
Doctor?

44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,450
医生。
Doctor.

45
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:47,950
嗯嗯?
Mm-hm?

46
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,390
你说只有一匹马没病。
You said there was only one horse that wasn't sick.

47
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,340
医生，请问是哪一个?
Please, Doc, which one?

48
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,000
所有的信息都是机密的，知道吗?
All that information is confidential, you know?

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,080
有点像医生和病人之间的关系。
Sort of between doctor and patient.

50
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,940
我们不会告诉任何人。
We wouldn't tell anybody.

51
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,510
你可以和我们分享你的秘密。
You could share your secret with us.

52
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,780
我们会和你分享我们的奖金。
And we'd share our winnings with you.

53
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,850
哦不，求你了，求你了。
Oh no, please, please.

54
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,220
那是不道德的。
That would be unethical.

55
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,760
不过，如果比赛结束后，你愿意为诊所捐点东西吗?
However, if after the race, you'd Like to donate something to the clinic?

56
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,450
我们太拥挤了，每张床上都有两匹马。
We're so overcrowded, we have two horses in every bed.

57
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,830
哦，当然，我们会的。
Oh, certainly, we will.

58
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,390
哪匹马感觉不错?
Uh, which horse feels well?

59
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,510
如果我是个赌徒，我会认为S-I-X是个非常幸运的数字。
Well, if I were a betting man, I'd Consider S-I-X a very lucky number.

60
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,590
骶髂关节……嘘。
S-I... Shh.

61
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,510
好了，安静。
All right, shush.

62
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,720
——S-I-X。-那是伦巴舞。
- S-I-X. - That's Rhumba Dancer.

63
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,500
来吧，艾伦。
Come on, Ellen.

64
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,250
谢谢你，医生。
Thank you, Doctor.

65
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,640
你为你的职业增光。
You're a credit to your profession.

66
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,630
哦，没什么。
Oh, ho, it's nothing.

67
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,100
不好意思。
Uh, excuse me.

68
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,380
请原谅我这么挤进来，我大老远从芝加哥飞过来就是为了看我哥哥的比赛。
Pardon me for crowding in, but I flew all the way from Chicago To see my brother ride this race.

69
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,250
我第一次看到他骑冠军。
First time I get to see him ride a winner.

70
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,840
他哥哥是个骑师。
His brother's a jockey.

71
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,510
有趣的事情。
Funny thing.

72
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,410
妈妈一直以为他会是个子高的那个。
Mom always thought he was going to be the tall one.

73
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,810
你怎么知道你哥哥会赢?
How do you know your brother's going to win?

74
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,460
有很多方法可以修好，除非他们想把东西弄歪。
Lots of ways it's fixed, unless they Try to pull something crooked.

75
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,800
有时候，马也会自己做交易。
Sometimes, the horses make their own deals, too, you know.

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,540
好吧，你弟弟叫什么名字?
Uh, well, uh, what's your brother's name?

77
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,390
我们也要为他加油。
We'd like to cheer for him, too.

78
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,110
如果你知道，你就知道是哪匹马了。
If you knew that, you'd know which horse.

79
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,400
哦，你不会后悔的。
Oh, you won't be sorry.

80
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,830
比赛结束后我会照顾你的。
I'll take care of you after the race.

81
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,690
一大块。
A big chunk.

82
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,190
哦。
Oh.

83
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,450
我不是那么在乎钱。
Well, I don't care about the money so much.

84
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,840
毕竟，你们看起来确实像正派人。
After all, you do look like decent people.

85
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,500
数字是S-E-V-E-N。
The number is S-E-V-E-N.

86
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,310
S-E-V-E-N。那是铁棒。
S-E-V-E-N. That's Iron Bar.

87
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,800
我们真高兴能遇到你。
Oh, we're so glad we happened to meet you.

88
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,810
你相信吗?
Would you believe it?

89
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,750
这是我们今天赢的第一场比赛。
This is the first race we've won today.

90
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,270
好吧,然后……哦,有…这是你哥哥。
Well, then... Oh, there... there's your brother now.

91
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,910
嗯?
Hm?

92
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,270
哦，嗨，杰瑞!
Oh, hi, Jerry!

93
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,270
爸爸妈妈向你问好。
Mom and Dad send their love.

94
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,000
祝你好运，孩子!
Lots of luck, kid!

95
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,990
看到他怎么假装不认识我了吗?
See how he pretends not to know me?

96
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,310
最聪明的小操作员。
Smartest little operator around.

97
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,150
我告诉你，先生，我知道我们在圣诞节比赛。
I tell you, sir, I know we race Christmas Day.

98
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,690
听着，孩子，我得确定。
Look, sonny, I got to be sure.

99
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,600
现在，帮我去问问威尔金森法官。
Now, go ask Judge Wilkinson for me.

100
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,740
嗯嗯。
Mm-hm.

101
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,070
他们还在印美元，是吧?
They're still printing dollars, huh?

102
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,940
哦，你说什么，女士?
Oh, I beg your pardon, ma'am?

103
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,220
你们都在跟我说话?
Y'all addressing me?

104
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,540
好吧，亲爱的孩子，你是不是把这5美元掉在地上了?
Well, honey child, Did y'all just dropped this $5 bill?

105
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,880
哦,我……我不可能。
Oh, I... I couldn't have.

106
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,390
我的都是百位。
Mine are all hundreds.

107
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,190
是的，我的也是。
Yeah, mine, too.

108
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,680
它一定是某个北方佬的。
It must belong to some Yankee.

109
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,130
你们一定很幸运，因为你们很漂亮。
Well, y'all must be as lucky as you are beautiful.

110
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,750
我的绅士朋友把这一切都押在了铁棒上。
My gentleman friend is betting all this on Iron Bar.

111
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,680
铁酒吧?
Iron Bar?

112
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,340
好吧，玉米饼和猪肠!
Well, corn my pone and chit my chitlins!

113
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,970
我本来打算自己在那匹马身上留下一个漂亮的身材，直到我叔叔告诉我比赛已经安排好了。
I was going to drop a handsome figure on that animal Myself until my uncle told me the race was fixed.

114
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,600
你的叔叔吗?
Your uncle?

115
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,110
是的。
Yeah.

116
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,160
那是威尔金森法官。
Well, that's Judge Wilkinson.

117
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,400
他是赛马俱乐部的头牌，也是终点线的主审。
He's the president of the Turf Club, And also, the head judge of the finish line.

118
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,130
我现在只是在等他点头。
I'm just waiting now for him to give me the nod.

119
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,230
当然，他是在调查。
He's investigating, of course.

120
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,560
我的，首席裁判!
My, head judge!

121
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,300
这是他。
That's him.

122
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,470
有漂亮女孩的那个。
The one with the pretty girl.

123
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,480
他给了我1美元问你圣诞节那天我们是否比赛。
He gives me $1 to ask you if we race on Christmas Day.

124
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,270
他不相信我的话。
He won't take my word for it.

125
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,990
一定是个游客。
Must be a tourist.

126
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,640
好吧，如果比赛注定铁棒会输，你必须知道谁会赢。
Well, if the race is fixed for Iron Bar to lose, You must know who's going to win.

127
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,110
是啊，但我不能泄露那样的信息。
Yeah, but I couldn't divulge information Like that.

128
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,110
我发过誓要保守秘密。
I've been sworn to secrecy.

129
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,060
我以南方真正绅士的身份发誓。
I gave my word as a true gentleman of the South.

130
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,030
我对着一堆黑眼豌豆和蜜饯山药发誓。
I swore on a stack of black eyed peas and candied yams.

131
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,350
这封邮件已被绑定。
This message had been binded.

132
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,410
这里有两千现金。
There's two thousand cash-money here.

133
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,300
我的绅士朋友会在比赛结束后好好照顾你的。
My gentleman friend would take good care of you After the race.

134
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,420
好吧，祝福你的心，亲爱的孩子。
Well, bless your heart, honey child.

135
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,010

你要大展拳脚了吗?

145
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,790
我在扩大我的生意。

你拿到那些战利品了吗?

148
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,000
有个西红柿和她自己的卷心菜块。
There's a tomato with her own cabbage patch.

149

噢!
Ow!

152
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,880

穆斯·莫兰总是下大赌注。

154
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,660
驼鹿莫兰吗?

155
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,450
你是说那个娃娃是穆斯·莫兰的?

156

你不知道?

嘿，你最好确定你给了他一个赢家。

158
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,500
一个胜利者吗?

159
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,680
我分不清一匹马和另一匹马。
I don't know one horse from another.

160
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,170
我最好抓住她，告诉她手术结束了，让她换电话号码。说…
I better grab her and tell her the fix is off, have her change Her number. Say...

161
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,550

165
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,380
你想双手沾上我的血。
You want my blood on your hands.

166
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,880

174
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,630
你们都认识那个好人吗?
Y'all know the nice man?

175
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,620
嗯嗯。

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,550
我跟那个好人说了比赛结束后给他点东西。

孩子，铁棒带着它跑了。

185
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,310

看那匹马跑!

铁棒轻松获胜。

198
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,350
还有闪电条纹。

199
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,670
但这个好人确信闪电条纹会赢。
But the nice man was sure Lightning Streak Was going to win.

200
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,390
慕斯生气了吗?
Is Moose angry?

201
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,180
喂，你刚才说得对。
Say, you were right before.

202
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,290
我在兜售那匹马。
I was touting that horse.

203
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:52,790
我承认。
I admit it.

204
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,320
我承认!
I confess!

205
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,710
我整个下午都在卖马。

206
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,340
把我关进监狱。
Put me in jail.

207
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,260
请把我关进监狱!
Please put me in jail!

208
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,110
你在开玩笑吗?
Are you kidding?

209
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,270
这是什么新把戏啊?
What kind of a new racket is this?

210
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,250
我是美国公民。
Well, I'm a citizen.

211
00:09:59,250 --> 00:09:59,770
我交税。
I pay taxes.

212
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,840
我有权被关进监狱。

213
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
给我耳光!
Slap them on me!

214
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,430
你又想把我们变成笨蛋吗?
Are you trying to make chumps out of us again?

215
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,400
不，我只是不小心吹捧了慕斯·莫兰。
No, I just touted Moose Moran by mistake.

216
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,320
我吹捧他是赢家。
I touted him off a winner.

217
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,300
他会杀了我的。
He'll kill me.

218
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,900
你知道，我们也知道慕斯·莫兰也知道。
Well, you know it and we know it and Moose Moran knows this.

219
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,660
但在法庭上听起来很奇怪。
But it would sound very peculiar in court.

220
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,210
我会让他们起草的。
I'll have them draft it.

221
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,930
我的钥匙呢?

222
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,970
信贷经理想和你谈谈。
The credit manager wants to talk to you.

223
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,840
你不想和信贷经理谈谈吗?
Do you not want to talk to the credit manager?

224
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,230
-你想和慕斯谈谈。-不，不。
- You want to talk to Moose. - No, no.

225
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,570
我…我不想和他们任何一个说话。
I... I don't want to talk to either one of them.

226
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,400
我…慕斯想请你和他喝一杯。
I... Well, Moose wants you to have a drink with him.

227
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,510
不，我不渴。

228
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,450
慕斯说你渴了。
Moose said you're thirsty.

229
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,750
不,我……我改天再约。
No, I... I'll take a rain check.

230
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,560
慕斯喜欢你。
Moose likes you.

231
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,490
是啊，我也喜欢他。
Yeah, I'm fond of him, too.

232
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,240
我们出去吧。
Let's go outside.

233
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,180
是的。不,伙计们。
Yeah. No, fellas.

234
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,910
我已经决定了!
I've made up my mind!

235
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,410
我们走吧。
Let's go.

236
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,090
我想我会晚一点回来的!
I'll be back later, I think!

237
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,550
我将……哈哈。
I'll be... ha-ha.

238
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,590
你儿子说你想和我喝一杯真有趣。
Funny when your boys said you wanted to have a drink with me.

239
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,610
我还以为他们在开玩笑呢。
I thought they were kidding.

240
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,110
哈哈。
Ha-ha.

241
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:52,980
谢谢你,斯佳丽。
Thanks, Scarlett.

242
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,420
慕斯，你是个可靠的公民，能承受这样的损失。
Moose, you're a real solid citizen, Taking your loss like this.

243
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,830
我为什么要为了一万块得高血压?
Why should I get high blood pressure for about ten grand?

244
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,740
是的，我就是这么说的。
Yeah, that's what I say.

245
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,550
不值得……十大吗?
It's not worth... ten grand?

246
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,110
我以为你只丢了两个?
I thought you only lost two?

247
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,120
是的，但是马赢了。
Yeah, but the horse won.

248
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,990
他们会付给我一万美元的。
They would have paid me ten grand.

249
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,870
来吧，我带你四处看看。
Come on, I'll show you around.

250
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,500
这样的布局，即使是一万美金也不便宜吧?
Say, with a layout like this, even ten grand Must be bird feed, huh?

251
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,040
是的。
Yeah.

252
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,060
这里有个小洞。
Over here is a sort of den.

253
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,480
把它修理得很特别。

254
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,600
噢!

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,080

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,110
啊!
Ugh!

261
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,910
噢。
Ow.

262
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,210
也许他没有钻石。
Maybe he ain't got the diamond.

263
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,350
慕斯认为是他在豪华轿车里吞下的。
Moose thinks he swallowed it when We had him in the limousine.

264
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,180
准备好了,山姆?
Ready, Sam?

265
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,010
噢!
Ow!

怎么了，孩子?
What's the matter, Kid?

268
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,780
你看起来有点不舒服。
You look kind of sick.

269
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,700
不，不，每年这个时候我都会变绿。
No, no, uh, I always turn green this time of the year.

270
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,620
哦!
Ohh!

271
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,170
也许你最好坐下来。
Maybe you'd better sit down.

272
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,190
至少。
At least.

273
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,810
啊呀!
Aargh!

274
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,190
不，别说了，我来说吧。

我要说话。

276
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,850
啊。

277
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,280
我没有吞下钻石。
I didn't swallow the diamond.

278
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,640
它在我的鞋里…在鞋跟。
It's in my shoe... in the heel.

279
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,860
既然你感觉好多了，我们来谈谈你欠我的一万块钱吧。
Now, that you're feeling better, Let's talk about the ten grand you owe me.

280
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,780
哦，但是你说…不，不是钱的问题。
Oh, but you said... No, it's not the money.

281
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,920
我只是不想让那些聪明人嘲笑我。
I just don't like to have all the smart guys get The laugh on me.

282
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,190
这是钻石，慕斯。
Here's the diamond, Moose.

283
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,290
小子，我想让你认识一下外科医生山姆。
Oh, Kid, I'd like you to know Sam the Surgeon.

284
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,610
山姆，这是柠檬小子。
Sam, this is the Lemon Drop Kid.

285
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,790
请原谅我的手套。
Pardon the glove.

286
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,220
你是真正的医生吗?
Are you a genuine doctor?

287
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,100
实际上。
Practically.

288
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,940
如果我不是高三的时候丢了个正考，我早就毕业了。
Would have graduated if I didn't drop A forward pass in my senior year.

289
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,470
我认识的第一个医生把他取出来的东西扔掉了。
First doctor I ever met keeps what He takes out and throws the patient away.

290
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,170
好吧，我要走了。
Well, I'll be going.

291
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:49,510
哦，哦，看，慕斯，我只有15美分和一盒柠檬糖。
Oops, oh, look, Moose, all I got is fifteen cents and a box of lemon drops.

292
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,010
你有吗?
You have one?

293
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,510
慕斯，我没有一万块钱。
Moose, I haven't got ten grand.

294
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,400
我身上没带，体内也没带。
I haven't got it on me or in me.

295
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,930
想把我变成傻瓜是很痛苦的。
Trying to make me a sucker can be very painful.

296
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,150
我们要为他做手术准备吗?
Shall we prepare him for surgery?

297
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,940
等等，慕斯。
Oh, now, wait, Moose.

298
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,810
听着，我会拿到一万美元的。
Look, I'll get the ten grand.

299
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:09,000
我将……"离圣诞节只有23天购物了"
I'll... hey, "Only 23 shopping days till Christmas."

300
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,440
要是我能活到圣诞节就好了。
If I only had till Christmas.

301
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,840
你从哪儿弄来一万块钱?
Where would you get ten grand?

302
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,150
如果我能去纽约，我就会有更多的机会。
Well, I'll have more of a chance If I could get to New York.

303
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,420
我在百老汇有很多朋友。
I've got a lot of friends on Broadway.

304
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,440
一个名字。
Name one.

305
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,550
嗯，有，呃，还有，呃…呃，他还没出来。
Well, there's, uh, and then there's, Uh... uh, he's not out yet.

306
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,790
嗯，好吧，他们不是朋友。
And the, eh, OK, so they're not friends.

307
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,240
我告诉你，我还能筹到钱。
I tell you, I can still raise the money.

308
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,420
通过兜售两美元的马匹玩家?
By touting two-dollar horse players?

309
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,000
不，我会想办法的。
No, I'll find a way.

310
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,540
不管山姆现在杀了我还是圣诞节前不打开我，对你来说都一样。
It's all the same to you whether Sam kills me Now or doesn't open me till Christmas.

311
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,550
如果我拿到钱，你就能提前一万。
And if I get the money, you are ten grand ahead.

312
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,460
你看，慕斯?
You see, Moose?

313
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,000
拿一万美金对你来说很有趣。
Picking up ten grand will be fun for you.

314
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,930
这样杀了我，太草率了。
And killing me this way, it'd be so sloppy.

315
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,240
慕斯，当然，我一直都想成为城里的男人，但不是小打小闹，你知道。
Moose, sure, I've always wanted to be a man about town, But not in little chunks, you see.

316
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,200
作为，呃，呃…死了，我就把一万记下来。
As, uh, uh... Dead, I write ten thousand off the books.

317
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,100
还活着，可能是线人。
Alive, possible asset.

318
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,090
好的，我会在纽约过圣诞节。
OK, I'll be in New York for Christmas.

319
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,710
我想和我的妻子和孩子一起度过。
I want to spend it with my wife and kids.

320
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,650
他们在寄宿学校。
They're in boarding school.

321
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,000
如果他跑了怎么办?
What if he runs away?

322
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,210
我们会找到他的。
We'll find him.

323
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:08,370
是啊，我听说你能找到这么好的人，在你找到他们之后，没人能找到他们。
Yeah, I hear you find people so good that after you find them, Nobody else can find them.

324
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,010
孩子，我在长岛有个赌场。
Kid, I got some property in Long Island, a casino.

325
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,790
哦，我知道那个地方。
Oh, I know the place.

326
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,040
他们关闭了它进行维修。
They closed it down for repairs.

327
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,110
轮盘赌开始有了回报。
The roulette wheel started paying off.

328
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,940
我要到北方来卖它。
I'm coming North to peddle it.

329
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,750
平安夜你要给我钱。
You have the money for me Christmas Eve.

330
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,790
或者圣诞节的早晨，你会发现你的头在袜子里。
Or Christmas morning, you'll find your head In your stocking.

331
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,120
我的头在袜子里?
My head in my stocking?

332
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,530
好吧，那不是po…哦,哦。
Well, that's not po... oh, oh.

333
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,470
谢谢你陪我度过一个愉快的夜晚。
Thanks for a nice evening.

334
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,470
圣诞快乐!
Merry Christmas!

335
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,980
你很幸运，我来了。
Lucky thing for you, I came along.

336
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,910
谢谢你，先生。
Thank you, sir.

337
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,940
你为什么不看路呢?
Why don't you watch where you're going?

338
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,390
我本想吹喇叭的，但它冻住了。
I would have blown my horn, but it's frozen.

339
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,130
你看，这样的天气，我的报纸销量一直不太好。
You see, the way the weather is, My paper sales have been a way off.

340
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,150
但我会想办法帮你弄到的。
But I'll get it for you some way.

341
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,800
我有朋友在附近。
I got friends about.

342
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,300
内莉!
Nellie!

343
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,910
我…就我所知，今天是内莉·星期四!
I... As I practically live and breathe, it's Nellie Thursday!

344
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,840
孩子!
Kid!

345
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,270
卖冰淇淋?
Selling ice cream?

346
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,960
冰淇淋。
Ice creams.

347
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,850
内尔还是老样子。
Same old Nell.

348
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,390
天啊，见到你真高兴。
Boy, am I glad to see you.

349
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,350
哦，我很高兴见到你。
Oh, and am I glad to see you.

350
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,040
你来得正是时候，小子。
You're just in time, Kid.

351
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,100
这是佛罗里达最新的东西…比基尼毛衣。
It's the newest thing in Florida... the bikini sweater.

352
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,960
制作它的女孩给我签了名。
The gal that made it autographed it for me.

353
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,890
汪,汪。
Woof, woof.

354
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,270
孩子，我欠伊根先生钱。
Kid, I owe Mr. Egan some money.

355
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,510
你还记得你欠我的20美元吗?
You remember that twenty dollars you owe me?

356
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,600
什么，可怜的20美元?
What, a measly twenty dollars?

357
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,930
我不仅记得这20，我还会把它还上，然后乘以20。
And I not only remember the twenty, I'm gonna pay it back and multiply it by twenty.

358
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,000
够她付我四个月的房租了，还有一些。
That'll take care of the four months' rent she owes me, And then some.

359
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,500
你别插手。
You keep out of this.

360
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,450
听着，内莉，借我十块钱，好吗?
Listen, Nellie, lend me ten dollars, will you?

361
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,670
这样我就能把冬天的衣服拿回来了?
So I can get my winter clothes out of hock?

362
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,530
我不能穿成这样去雪莉和丽兹见我的朋友。
I can't go see my friends at the Sherry And the Ritz looking like this.

363
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,060
他们会问我一些我不知道答案的问题。
They'd ask me questions for which I'm out of answers.

364
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,420
孩子，你知道你在丽兹没有朋友。
Kid, you know you have not any friends at the Ritz.

365
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,910
内莉，你怎么能这么说?
Nellie, how can you say that?

366
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,200
你知道的。
You know I have.

367
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,680
为什么有…手不对。
Why there's... uh, wrong hand.

368
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:22,530
嗯，有，呃，呃…别担心，我会把钱还给你的。
Well, there's, uh, uh... don't worry, I'll give you the money back.

369
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,730
6点前拿到。
Get it by 6 o'clock.

370
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,930
这样你就有时间占领孤儿院了。
That'll give you time to dispossess an orphanage.

371
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,410
你知道吗，内莉，如果我有内裤，我会把我身上的衬衫都给你。
You know, Nellie, I'd give you the shirt off my back If I had any underwear on.

372
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,370
当然,孩子。
Sure, Kid.

373
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,810
我知道。
I know that.

374
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,250
不只是我。
It's not just for me.

375
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,210
是给我丈夫的。
It's for my husband.

376
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,460
你还记得我丈夫亨利吗?
You remember my husband, Henry?

377
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,950
谁不喜欢呢?
Well, who doesn't?

这是业界最棒的保险箱小撬。
Greatest little safe cracker in the business.

380
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,620
亨利二十年后就要假释了。
Henry's getting paroled after twenty years.

381
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,080
他平安夜出狱。
He gets out Christmas Eve.

382
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,570
平安夜出去?
Gets out Christmas Eve?

383
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,400
圣诞夜。
Christmas Eve.

384
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,970
我可能见不到他了。
I may not be around to see him.

385
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,050
但我会的，这样我就可以告诉他我们没地方住了。
But I will, so I can tell him how we got no place to stay.

386
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,400
是啊，那你和亨利要搬去的那个老人院呢?
Yeah, well, what happened to that old folks' home That you and Henry were moving in?

387
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,770
是的，阳光之家。
Yes, Sunshine Home, huh.

388
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,120
他们拒绝了我的申请…都是为了亨利。
Well, they turned down my application... All on account of Henry.

389
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,840
他们不会收有前科的人。
They won't take an ex-convict.

390
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,770
下次探访日，我会告诉亨利待在原地不动。
Come next visiting day, I'm going To tell Henry to stay right where he is.

391
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,760
至少，那里是暖和的。
At least, it's warm up there.

392
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
即。

嗯，也许是这样。
Well, maybe so.

00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,790
我以前从没见过它开花。
I never saw it bloom before.

410
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,990
啊，还能用。
Ah, still works.

411
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,700
如果你必须死，那是什么罪啊。
What a crime if you had to die.

412
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,420
哦，一个花花公子。
Oh, a dandy.

413
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,320
人力资源管理。
Hrm.

414
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,280
我讨厌离开你，但这是命运!
I hate to leave you, but that's fate!

415
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,240
哦，你这个娃娃，你!
Oh, you doll, you!

416
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,160
Brainey !
Brainey!

417
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,050
Brainey !
Brainey!

418
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,480
Brainey !
Brainey!

419
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,330
Brainey !
Brainey!

420
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,570
布雷尼，你这个漂亮的娃娃，你!
Brainey, you gorgeous doll, you!

421
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,980
你迟到了，小子。
You're late, Kid.

422
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,080
我一到城里就过来了。
Oh, I came over as soon as I hit town.

423
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,480
迟了六个月。
Six months late.

424
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,630
你拿走了我的外套。
You left with my coat.

425
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,400
你本来要帮我当掉的。
You were going to pawn it for me.

426
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,830
我在等你回来。
I waited for you to come back.

427
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,810
是这样的。
Well, it's like this.

428
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,900
我正拿着你的钱回来。
I was on my way back with your money right in my hand.

429
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,270
突然，我听说佛罗里达有一笔大生意。
All at once, I heard about a big deal in Florida.

430
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,150
我想你在佛罗里达不需要皮大衣。
Well, I figured you won't need a fur coat in Florida.

431
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,430
你去了佛罗里达，我留在这里。
You went to Florida, I stayed here.

432
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,440
哦,Brainey。
Oh, Brainey.

433
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,570
用这件大衣偿还我欠你的钱是轻而易举的事。
Squaring the money I owe you in the coat is a cinch.

434
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,650
我刚在迈阿密发了财。
I just struck it rich in Miami.

435
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,980
嗯，你看起来很像。
Mm, you look it.

436
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,290
哦，你不明白。
Oh, you don't understand.

437
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:26,480
我和一些有钱的朋友在赛马场，我想到了我爱的女人…也就是你，布莱尼·巴克斯特。
I'm out at the racetrack with some wealthy friends, And I get to thinking about the woman I love... meaning you, Brainey Baxter.

438
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,050
当然，我不会等着改变。
Naturally, I don't wait to change.

439
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,410
我赶了第一班飞机回家。
I grabbed the first plane home.

440
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,350
我的行李在路上。
My luggage is on the way.

441
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,210
如果迈阿密很胖，你怎么走得这么急?
If Miami is fat, how come you left in such a hurry?

442
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,800
哦，呃，有一匹马叫婚礼仪式…赢得第二场比赛。
Oh, uh, there's a horse named Wedding Ceremony... wins the second race.

443
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,130
婚礼，这是预感。
Wedding Ceremony, that's a hunch.

444
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,570
除了你和我，谁都有可能。
It could mean nobody but you and I.

445
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,800
现在，看，小子。
Now, look, Kid.

446
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,460
我记得你是怎么操作的。
I remember how you operate.

447
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,880
没有限制。
No holds barred.

448
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,490
现在，我们不要谈论婚礼除非你是诚实的。
Now, let's not talk about a wedding ceremony Unless you're on the level.

449
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,620
我不怪你不信任我，布雷尼。
Oh, I don't blame you for not trusting me, Brainey.

450
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,770
有时候我不相信自己。
Sometimes I have days when I don't trust me.

451
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,170
但为了配得上你，我愿意做任何事。
But I'll do anything to be worthy of you.

452
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,360
说不定还能找到工作。
Might even get a job.

453
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,020
婚礼和工作?
A wedding ceremony and a job?

454
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,040
这是今年最伟大的一次冒险。
That's the greatest long shot parlay of the year.

455
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,540
是的。
Yeah.

456
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,510
我真希望我没把钱包落在我的新羊绒裤子里。
I just wish I hadn't left my wallet in my new cashmere Slacks.

457
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,650
等我的衣服一到，我就带十块钱去拿驾照。
As soon as my clothes arrive, I'll take ten bucks and go right down And get a license.

458
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,230
这就告诉你了。
That'll show you.

459
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,590
我有十块钱。
I've get ten bucks.

460
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,090
是吗?
Yeah?

461
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,910
我说你是在虚张声势，小子。
I'm calling your bluff, Kid.

462
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,970
我们现在就能拿到执照。
We can get the license right now.

463
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,590
哦,娃娃!
Oh, doll!

464
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,030
我马上去执照局。
I'll be right down to the license bureau.

465
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,570
哦,等等!
Oh, wait!

466
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,500
我要穿什么东西了。
I'll slip into something.

467
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,600
哦，不要，不要。
Oh, don't, no.

468
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,990
你不需要一起去。
No need you going along.

469
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,080
你留在这里，把这里收拾好。
You stay here and fix up this place.

470
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,580
记住，这是我们的蜜月小屋。
Remember, this is our honeymoon cottage.

471
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,280
有很多香槟和五彩纸屑，是吧?
Get a lot of champagne and confetti, huh?

472
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,530
就站在那里，就像这样。
And just stand there, just like that.

473
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,520
漂亮!
Beautiful!

474
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,020
一路走到市区，我想记住你的微笑。
All the way downtown, I want to remember you smiling.

475
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,020
但我们都得去领执照。
But we both have to appear for a license.

476
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,880
嘿，小子，等等!
Hey, Kid, wait!

477
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,250
我的十块钱。
My ten bucks.

478
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,610
他又这样做了。
He did it again.

479
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,620
团聚,伙计们。
Reunion, fellas.

480
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,440
Hrrrm。
Hrrrm.

481
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,600
糊，糊，糊，糊!
Mush, mush, mush, mush!

482
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,980
查理先生，根据我们的数据，你欠31400美元。
Mr. Charlie, according to our figures, You owe the government $31,400.

483
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,290
你是说，我付的保护费不能扣减吗?
You mean to say, all that dough I Paid for protection isn't deductible?

484
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:44,080
那笔钱只是…你想要什么?
Well, that money is just... what do you want?

485
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,340
嗯，我只是路过。
Well, I was just passing by.

486
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,250
我想去看看我的老朋友牛津·查理。
Thought I'd drop in to see my old pal Oxford Charlie.

487
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,410
你好吗?
How are you?

488
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,800
你的脚怎么样了?
How's your feet?

489
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,260
他们要杀了我。
They're killing me.

490
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,230
你来这儿干什么?给予还是得到?
What are you here for... Giving or getting?

491
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,300
查理，我要跟你分一杯羹。
Oh, Charlie, I'm cutting you in on a solid gold deal.

492
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,900
你可以用你那份利润穿貂皮牛津鞋了。
You'd be able to wear ermine oxfords With your share of the profits.

493
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,990
你只要拿出一万现金就行了。
All you have to put up is ten grand in cash.

494
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,770
这就够了。
That's enough.

495
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,010
把面包屑扔出去。
Throw the crumb out.

496
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,990
但你只需要种上区区一万美元，就能收获一大笔钱!
But all you have to do is plant a measly ten grand, And you harvest a fortune!

497
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,650
把他扔出去。
Throw him out.

498
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,380
我所得税的麻烦还不够多吗?
Ain't I got enough trouble with income tax?

499
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,620
哦，但是，查理!
Oh, but, Charlie!

500
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,030
牛津，我欠穆斯·莫兰一万美元。
Listen, Oxford, I owe Moose Moran ten grand.

501
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,760
要么他在圣诞夜收到，要么我在圣诞节早上收到。
Either he gets it Christmas Eve or I get it Christmas morning.

502
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,730
把钱借给我，好吗?
Lend me the dough, will you?

503
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,660
你知道慕斯会做什么。
You know what Moose will do.

504
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,730
我就会穿着水泥泳衣被扔进河里。
I'll wind up in the river with a cement bathing suit.

505
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,980
我来供应水泥。
I'll supply the cement.

506
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,480
出去!
Out!

507
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,740
哦，但是，查理，我…查……我留下我的电话号码以防你改变主意?
Oh, but, Charlie, I... Cha... I'll leave my phone number In case you change your mind, huh?

508
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,800
对不起，哦!
I'm sorry, oh!

509
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,630

哦，至少你有一个。

00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,130
我的。
Mine.

549
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:05,820
来吧，孩子。
Come on, Kid.

550
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,590
哦，不，等一下。
Oh, no, wait a minute.

551
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,440
我什么都没做。
I haven't done anything.

552
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,360
我是无辜的。
I'm innocent.

553
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,630
我只是个小商人。
I'm just a small businessman.

554
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,700
我是做圣诞老人生意的。
I'm in the Santa Claus business.

555
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,790
来吧，圣诞老人。
Come along, Santa.

556
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,140
我打电话叫驯鹿来。
I'll phone for the reindeer.

557
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,800
哦，我打车去车站接你。
Oh, I'll take a cab and meet you at the station.

558
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,330
西德尼·米尔本。
Sidney Milburn.

559
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,890
西德尼·米尔本!
Sidney Milburn!

560
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,830
法官阁下，那是柠檬小子。
Your Honor, that's the Lemon Drop Kid.

561
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,260
柠檬小子在为慈善机构募捐却没有执照。
The Lemon Drop Kid was collecting money for charity Without a license.

562
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:41,780
慈善是什么?
What charity?

563
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,240
他自己的，法官阁下
His own, Your Honor.

564
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
你如何辩护?
How do you plead?

565
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,510
法官阁下，我想请求将这个案子推迟到1月1日当我的律师从华盛顿回来时。
Well, Your Honor, I'd like to ask For a postponement of this case until January 1 When my attorney returns from Washington.

566
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,510
华盛顿?
Washington?

567
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:55,180
是的，他在下面帮杜鲁门总统处理一张停车罚单。
Yeah, he's down there trying to fix a parking Ticket for President Truman.

568
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,300
米尔本，你对行乞的指控有何辩护?
Milburn, how do you plead to this charge of panhandling?

569
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,200
行乞呢?
Panhandling?

570
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,070
我拿着铃铛和水壶站在角落里，就像成百上千个普通的美国圣诞老人一样。
I was standing in the corner with my bell and kettle, Like hundreds of other everyday average American Santa Clauses.

571
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,650
你收集这笔钱是为了一己私利。
You were collecting this money for your own personal gain.

572
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,300
其他人都在为慈善事业工作。
Those other men are working for charity.

573
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,700
这是一个有组织的慈善机构，有市政执照。
It's an organized charity and has a city license.

574
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,200
嗯。
Eh.

575
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,800
哦，城市执照。
Oh, a city license.

576
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,010
米尔本先生，我要把这笔钱捐给一个有价值的慈善机构。
Mr. Milburn, I'm going to turn this money over To a worthwhile charity.

577
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,830
十天或五十美元。
Ten days or fifty dollars.

578
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,060
哦，但是我没有50美元。
Oh, but I haven't got fifty dollars.

579
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,700
我可抽不出十天的时间。
And I can't spare ten days.

580
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,090
我们会为您安排时间。
We'll arrange your schedule to spare it for you.

581
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,860
下一个例子。
Next case.

582
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,900
哦，但是，法官，拜托。
Oh, but, Judge, please.

583
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,400
法官阁下，我能打个电话吗?
Your Honor, could I make one phone call?

584
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,130
是的。
Yes.

585
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,910
这是异地恋，我…
It's long distance, I...

586
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,580
来吧。
Come on.

587
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,340
在我看来那个法官不诚实。
That judge didn't look honest to me.

588
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,610
18年来，他一直是律师协会的成员。
For 18 years, he's been a member of the bar.

589
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,400
这就是我的意思。
That's what I mean.

590
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,120
上班时喝酒。
Drinking on duty.

591
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,350
你好,孩子。
Hello, Kid.

592
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,450
内莉吗?
Nellie?

593
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,590
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

594
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,580
问他。
Ask him.

595
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,800
他逮捕了我因为我试图把我的私人物品带出我的公寓。
He had me arrested for trying to get my personal belongings out Of my apartment.

596
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,400
但他甚至都不想让我给亨利拍照。
But he didn't even want me to take Henry's picture.

597
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,320
这是他唯一拍过的照片。
That's the only picture he ever had taken.

598
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,050
天啊，一点都没变。
Gee, hasn't changed a bit.

599
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,540
我们走吧。
Let's go.

600
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,710
你这个打女人的。
You woman beater.

601
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,670
来吧。
Come on.

602
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,630
叽阿。
Grrr.

603
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,390
来吧。
Come on.

604
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,160
来吧!
Come on!

605
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,220
哦，等等，等等。
Uh, oh, hold it, hold it.

606
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,890
举行什么?
Hold what?

607
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,700
持有这些。
Hold these.

608
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,290
法官说我可以请律师。
Judge told me I could call my lawyer.

609
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,620
你说你的律师在华盛顿。
You said your lawyer was in Washington.

610
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,280
是的，是邓肯，芒坎，施芒坎和布雷尼的公司。
Yeah, it's a firm of Duncan, Muncan, Schmuncan, and Brainey.

611
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,180
孩子，等我的律师跟你谈完，你就得半吊子了。
Boy, when my lawyer gets through with you, You'll be wearing your brass buttons at half mast.

612
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:33,390
喂?
Hello?

613
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,160
我…哦。
I... oh.

614
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,440
喂，布莱尼在吗?
Hello, is Brainey there?

615
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,210
是吗?
Yeah?

616
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,920
你好，Brainey。
Well, hello, Brainey.

617
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,700
你好,亲爱的。
Hiya, honey.

618
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,080
是个女律师。
It's a lady lawyer.

619
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,690
聪明宝贝，你以为我在哪里?
Brainey baby, where do you think I am?

620
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,090
别告诉我。
Don't tell me.

621
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,960
让我猜猜。
Let me guess.

622
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,200
当然是执照局。
The license bureau, of course.

623
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,310
你嫁给了自己。
You married yourself.

624
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,090
多么舒适。
How cozy.

625
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:00,590
现在,看看。
Now, look.

626
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,280
我是从执照局开始的，宝贝。
I started for the license bureau, baby.

627
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,090
但在下来的路上，我在我以前的宿舍停了下来给你拍了张照片。
But on the way down, I stopped off at my old rooming house To get your photograph.

628
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,860
我喜欢和你不在一起的时候看看它。
I like to look at it when I'm not with you.

629
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,740
房东不让我进去拿。
Well, the landlord wouldn't let me in to get it.

630
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,910
一件事接一件事。
So one thing led to another.

631
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,080
他戳了我一下。
He poked me.

632
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,790
我戳了他一下。
I poked him.

633
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:17,010
你觉得我现在在哪?
And where do you think I am?

634
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,150
在牢房里。
In the pokey.

635
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,940
狭小的吗?
The pokey?

636
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,070
呆在那里，保持你原来的样子，美丽。
Stay there, just the way you are, beautiful.

637
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:28,010
我想记住你微笑的样子。
I want to remember you smiling.

638
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:28,880
微笑?
Smiling?

639
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,170
看，谁在笑?
Look, who's smiling?

640
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:34,570
我…你能离开镇子几个小时吗，拜托了?
I'd... Look, would you leave town for a couple of hours, please?

641
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,490
听着，聪明宝贝，你得听我说。
Look, Brainey baby, you got to listen to me.

642
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,400
听你的?
Listen to you?

643
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,030
我的皮大衣听了你的话。
My fur coat listened to you.

644
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,380
我的十块钱听了你的话。

645
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,340
我听了你的话。
I listened to you.

646
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,360
我们都听够了你的话。
We're all fed up listening to you.

647
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,010
嗨，布雷尼，我们开始了!
Hey, Brainey, we're on!

648
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,390
再见，小子。
So long, Kid.

649
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,680
圣诞快乐!
Merry Christmas!

650
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,060
记住，如果我不联系你，无论如何，不要联系我。
And remember, if I don't get in touch with you, by all means, Don't get in touch with me.

651
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,670
不，Brainey, Brainey, Brainey宝贝。
No, Brainey, Brainey, Brainey baby.

652
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,220
Brainey，去…好吧，呃，我…拿着这个。
Brainey, go to... right, uh, I, wha... here hold this.

653
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,610
她不能这样对我。
She can't do this to me.

654
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,370
回来吧，圣诞老人。
Come back here, Santa.

655
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:16,800
你会……至少，我不赔不赚。
Would you... at least, I broke even.

656
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:24,480
然后你听到一声咆哮，你以为他们还想要更多，所以你开始疯狂地唱歌。
Then you hear such a roar, And you think they want more, so you start in singing like mad.

657
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,870
你可以看到我们的形状很好。
You can see that we're shaped well.

658
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,920
你看，我们披得很好。
You see that we're draped well.

659
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,990
但我们可以从那些目瞪口呆的家伙身上看出来。
But we can tell by the fellows that gape.

660
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,010
他们喜欢听我们唱红红的歌。
Well, they like to hear us sing in the pink.

661
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,270
哦，邓克先生，多漂亮的貂皮啊。
Oh, Mr. Dunker, what a beautiful mink.

662
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:47,070
当你听到我唱，啊-啊-啊，啊-啊-啊，你一定会从每一小节中得到快乐!
You must get pleasure from every measure when you hear me sing, Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah!

663
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,970
我认为。
I think.

664
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,060
我的想法吗?
I think?

665
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,450
当我们发声时，你的反应令人惊讶。
Your reaction is surprising when we're doing our vocalizing.

666
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,920
是啊，你显然是来看我们唱歌的。
Yes, you obviously came just to see us sing.

667
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:02,840
好吧,女孩。
OK, girls.

668
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,730
6点回来。
Back at 6 o'clock.

669
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,790
-嗨。-嗨。
- Hi. - Hi.

670
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,370
一些早餐吗?
Some breakfast?

671
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,960
不用了，谢谢。
No, thank you.

672
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,520
查理，我不知道怎么…是的，是的，我知道。
Charlie, I don't know how... Yeah, yeah, I know.

673
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,080
我听说柠檬小子去酒壶了。
I heard about the Lemon Drop Kid going to the jug.

674
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,500
多少钱?
How much?

675
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,000
五十岁。
Fifty.

676
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,010
用我的工资。
Out of my salary.

677
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,430
嗯。
Hm.

678
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:25,820
你知道吗，为什么每次我追求一个女人，她最后都嫁给了那个鼓手?
You know, why is it every time I go for a dame, She winds up marrying the drummer?

679
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:31,280
大概在两个金发女郎之前，我在兰花和珍珠上花了很多钱，她勾搭上了一个服务员。
About two blondes ago, I shell a lot Of fortune in orchids and pearls, She hooks up with a waiter.

680
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,100
是啊，一个小胖子。
Huh, yeah, a little fat guy.

681
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,110
我才不要跟什么服务员搞在一起呢。
Well, I'm not getting hooked up with any waiter.

682
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,150
那小子骗了我几次，我不会让他得逞的。
The Kid pulled a couple of fast ones on me, And I'm not letting him get away with it.

683
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,150
他认为他在监狱里很安全。
He thinks he's safe in jail.

684
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,510
嗯。
Hm.

685
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,390
谢谢你,查理。
Thanks, Charlie.

686
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,080
我会还你钱的。
I'll pay you back in money.

687
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,580
是的。
Yeah.

688
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,650
怎么了，圣诞老人?
What's the matter, Santa Claus?

689
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,390
你的驯鹿闯红灯了?
Your reindeer gone through a red light?

690
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,340
圣诞老人今年不是个好孩子。
Santa Claus hasn't been a good boy this year.

691
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,130
他们在你包里发现了什么，圣诞老人?
What did they find in your bag, Santa?

692
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,090
盗窃工具吗?
Burglary tools?

693
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,700
乌合之众。
Riffraff.

694
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,390
有人来看你了，小子。
You got a visitor, Kid.

695
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,910
你的家庭医生。
Your family doctor.

696
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,390
嗯，外科医生山姆。
Well, Sam the Surgeon.

697
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,740
你提前来切圣诞菜了吗?
You come to do your Christmas chopping early?

698
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,390
不,圣诞老人。
No, Santa.

699
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,680
我是来提醒你慕斯·莫兰想要什么圣诞礼物的。
I came to remind you what Moose Moran wants for Christmas.

700
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,930
我记得。
I remember.

701
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,230
你知道吗，小子，躲在监狱里太蠢了。
You know, Kid, jail's a silly place to try to hide.

702
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,260
慕斯的朋友进的比出的多。
Moose has more friends in than out.

703
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,470
山姆，你可以把刀放在樟脑丸里。
Sam, you can put your knife in mothballs.

704
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,300
我有个好主意。
I got an idea that can't miss.

705
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,300
我知道我能弄到一万美元。
I know I can come up with the ten grand.

706
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:31,250
没关系，因为一些聪明的男孩开始逗慕斯笑了，慕斯不喜欢这样。
That's fine because some of the smart boys Are starting to get Moose to laugh, and Moose don't like it.

707
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,810
我们要做的就是从现在开始借用穆斯的赌场直到圣诞节。
All we have to do is borrow Moose's casino from now Till Christmas.

708
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,720
慕斯不能打开它进行高级赌博。
Moose can't open it for high-class gambling.

709
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,920
你连宾果游戏厅都打不开。
You can't even open it for a bingo parlor.

710
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,700
等等，你在和一个天才说话。
Wait, you're talking to a genius.

711
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,950
你认识Nellie Thursday吗?
You know Nellie Thursday?

712
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,550
她在这里。
She's in here.

713
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,300
她没有地方住。
She's got no place to live.

714
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,530
她想进养老院，但他们不收她，因为她丈夫有前科。
She tried to get into an old folks' home, But they wouldn't take her on account Of her husband's an ex-con.

715
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,120
这是我的想法。
Now, here's the idea.

716
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,910
我借了穆斯的赌场。
I borrow Moose's casino.

717
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,000
我假装这是一家老人院。
I pretend it's an old folks' home.

718
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,360
我把内莉和一堆旧娃娃放在一起。
I stick Nellie in there with a bunch of old dolls.

719
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,260
有他们在里面……这部分有点难。
With them in it... now, this part is kind of tough.

720
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,450
但我想，如果我能做到，我可以说服市政府给我一张为慈善募捐的执照。
But I figure, uh, if I can work it, I can talk the city into giving me A license to collect for charity.

721
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,690
我还想，我可以把百老汇所有的杯子都拿来帮我收集。
I further figure, I can get every mug on Broadway To help me do the collecting.

722
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,880
他们都喜欢内莉。
They all love Nellie.

723
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,590
她真是个漂亮的老娃娃。
She's such a grand old doll.

724
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,510
你想在慕斯的赌场里卖掉一群旧娃娃吗?
You trying to unload a mob of old dolls in Moose's casino?

725
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,130
嘘。
Shh.

726
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,300
只到平安夜。
It's only until Christmas Eve.

727
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,060
到那时，我就能筹到足够的钱还清穆斯。
By then, I'll have collected enough to pay off Moose.

728
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,800
这是我听过的最合法的欺骗。
This is the most legal double cross I've ever heard.

729
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,880
但是圣诞夜过后这些旧娃娃怎么办呢?
But what happens to the old dolls after Christmas Eve?

730
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:35,620
如果募捐的钱突然丢了而那些旧娃娃也没钱待在赌场了，我能控制得了吗?
Well, can I help it if suddenly the collection money Just happens to get lost and the old dolls Can't afford to stay in the casino?

731
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,500
慕斯会得到他的钱。
Moose will have his dough.

732
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,850
这样我就不会有麻烦了。
And I'll be in the clear, you see.

733
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:43,800
你要在圣诞节的时候把那些漂亮的小女人都扔到大街上吗?
You're going to dump all those nice little ladies out On the street at Christmastime?

734
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,280
我不会对自己的母亲这么做。
I wouldn't do that to my own mother.

735
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,980
城里任何一家庄家都会给你3比1。
Any bookmaker in town will give you 3-1.

736
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,960
这到底算不算交易?
Is it a deal or not?

737
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,780
听起来很疯狂。
Sounds crazy.

738
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,520
但那不是我的部门。
But that ain't my department.

739
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,990
如果你不给我钱，我就开始手术。
I only to start operating if you don't pay off.

740
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,820
你在哪里实习过?
Where did you intern at?

741
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,740
财务公司?
The finance company?

742
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,770
嘿，山姆，五十美元的罚款有点小问题。
And hey, Sam, there's a little matter of the fifty-dollar fine.

743
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,260
你先垫付，我就欠慕斯一万五。
You advance it, and I owe Moose a round figure of ten thousand and fifty.

744
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,490
不，谢谢，小子。
No, thanks, Kid.

745
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,590
我喜欢你被冷冻起来。
I like having you in the deep freeze.

746
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,620
我们可以在假期前让你暖和起来。
We can thaw you out in time for the holiday season.

747
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,310
再过15天圣诞快乐。
Merry Christmas in just 15 days.

748
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,960
圣诞快乐。
Merry Christmas.

749
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,680
15天。
15 days.

750
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,560
我得离开这里。
I got to get out of here.

751
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,430
我得离开这里!
I got to get out of here!

752
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,370
请放我出去!
Please let me out of here!

753
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:23,870
嘿!
Hey!

754
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,170
我早就该说"请"了。
I should have said "please" a long time ago.

755
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,170
有一位女士在办公室等你。
There's a lady waiting for you in the office.

756
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,980
她付了你的罚款。
She paid your fine.

757
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,870
再见,圣诞老人!
Goodbye, Santa!

758
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,080
犯!
Delinquents!

759
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,790
这是您的收据。
Here's your receipt.

760
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,520
谢谢你！
Thank you.

761
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,040
Brainey !
Brainey!

762
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,650
我就知道你会来。
I knew you'd come.

763
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,800
无法抗拒，是吗?
Couldn't fight it, eh?

764
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,990
我不知道我会对他们做什么。
I don't know what I'd do to them.

765
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,680
我猜，你在想我的衣服。
Well, I guess, you're wondering about the outfit.

766
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,180
哦，不，运动。
Oh, no, sport.

767
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,210
你总是穿着华丽。
You always were a flashy dresser.

768
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,300
你不知道重获自由是什么感觉。
You don't know how it feels to be free again.

769
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,380
你大概有五分钟的空闲时间。
Well, you're going to be free about five minutes.

770
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,290
我们要去市中心领结婚证。
We're heading downtown for a marriage license.

771
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,050
在一起。
Together.

772
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,020
Brainey，你让我成为世界上最幸福的男人!
Brainey, you're making me the happiest man in the world!

773
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:07,770
而且再也不会有每周为了区区几块钱跳舞的机会了……当你是我妻子的时候。
And there'd be no more dancing for a few measly dollars A week anymore... not when you're my wife.

774
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,330
我们会让牛津查理给你加薪的。
We'll make Oxford Charlie give you a raise.

775
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,280
哦，我不想工作……想想看，再过几周，我们就是柠檬小子夫妇了。
Oh, I don't want to work... Just think, in a few short weeks, We'll be Mr. And Mrs. Lemon Drop Kid.

776
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,440
短短几周?
A few short weeks?

777
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,010
这次的摊位是什么?
What's the stall this time?

778
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,220
好吧，来吧。
Well, come on.

779
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,460
你会为我感到骄傲的。
You'll be proud of me.

780
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,760
哦。
Oops.

781
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,050
嗨，你好，小子。
Hic, hello, Kid.

782
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,340
又在看电视了?
Been watching television again, huh?

783
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,240
警官，罪名是什么?
What's the charge, Officer?

784
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:39,290
我跟你说话的时候你能别排练了吗?
Hey, will you stop rehearsing when I'm trying to talk to you?

785
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,460
还记得那次轮到你输的时候你赢了吗?
Remember the time you win when it was your turn to lose?

786
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,040
谁把你藏了三个星期?
Who hide you off for three weeks?

787
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,070
内莉。
Nellie did.

788
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,420
但是，小子，你的个人角度是什么?
But, Kid, what's your personal angle?

789
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,430
闭上嘴，瑞典佬。
Button your lips, Swede.

790
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,110
内莉就像你的母亲。
Nellie is like a mother to you.

791
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,470
叽阿。
Grrr.

792
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,710
柠檬娃娃?
Lemon Drop Kid?

793
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,910
我只是不相信你不关心柠檬滴小孩。
I just don't believe you're not looking out For the Lemon Drop Kid.

794
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,130
但你必须相信。
But you got to believe it.

795
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,270
像Nellie Thursday这样的老太太肯定有好几百个。
There must be hundreds of old ladies like Nellie Thursday.

796
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,700
它们遍布百老汇大街。
They're all around Broadway.

797
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:19,180
老娃娃们进不了家，因为他们可能在过去卷了一卷，捣碎了一点自制啤酒。
Old dolls who can't get into homes because maybe they Rolled a lusher, pound a little homemade beer in the old days.

798
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,500
甚至是你自己的母亲。
Maybe even your own mother.

799
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,520
他们从来没有责怪过妈妈。
They never hung no rap on Mom.

800
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,680
同花顺托尼，去年你穷困潦倒的时候，谁把你押在了一副有标记的新牌上?
Straight Flush Tony, when you were down and out last year, Who staked you to a new deck of marked cards?

801
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,760
内莉!
Nellie!

802
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,890
好的!
OK!

803
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,680
所以大家都回家好好睡一觉吧。
So everybody go home and get a good night's sleep.

804
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,090
明天中午我们都要起床。
We're all getting up at noon tomorrow.

805
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,320
她来了。
There she is.

806
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,330
记住，一个字也别说。
Remember, not a word.

807
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,420
这是一个惊喜派对。
This is a surprise party.

808
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,360
你好,内莉。
Hello, Nellie.

809
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,280
孩子!
Kid!

810
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,410
哦，阴郁而诚实的哈利。
Oh, Gloomy and Honest Harry.

811
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,040
嘿，内莉。
Hey there, Nellie.

812
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,370
内尔，出来的感觉怎么样?
Ha, Nell, how does it feel to be out?

813
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,240
冷。
Cold.

814
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,410
哦,我的。
Oh, my.

815
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,030
我们有辆好车在等你。
We got a hot car waiting for you.

816
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,750
你们什么时候开始喜欢偷这个了?
Since when have you boys gone in for swiping this?

817
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,030
我们以为你会喜欢兜风的。
Oh, we thought you'd enjoy a little ride.

818
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,180
谢谢，但我要走路。
Thanks, but I'm walking.

819
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,110
在转角处有个小公寓。
There's a two-bit boarding house just around the corner.

820
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,450
好的，我们开车送你去。
Good, we'll drive you there.

821
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,380
你疯了，小子。
Oh, you're crazy, Kid.

822
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,900
等等，谁会开豪华轿车去廉价公寓?
Wait, who pulls up to a cheap boarding house in a limousine?

823
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,280
只有和朋友在一起的旧娃娃。
Only old dolls with friends.

824
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,640
进去。
Get in.

825
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,760
小子，这不是穆斯·莫兰以前的赌场吗?
Why, Kid, isn't this Moose Moran's old gambling casino?

826
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,600
穆斯·莫兰的老什么?
Moose Moran's old what?

827
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,820
“奈莉星期四回家给老娃娃。”
"Nellie Thursday Home for Old Dolls."

828
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,440
这是什么意思，小子?
What does this mean, Kid?

829
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,260
只是长岛的一间小公寓，内莉。
It's just a two-bit boarding house in Long Island, Nellie.

830
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:01,590
整块地都是后院，冷热相间的矮牵牛花，四面朝南，灰泥浴缸。
Whole field for a backyard, hot and cold running petunias, Southern exposure on all sides, stucco bathtubs.

831
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:08,460
对了，我差点忘了，有个房间给亨利，里面有个很大的保险箱供他练习。
Oh yeah, I almost forgot, there's A room for Henry with a nice big safe for him to practice on.

832
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,500
嘿,小子。
Hey, Kid.

833
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,420
我和Goomba在公园里发现了这个…解锁。
Me and Goomba found this in the park... unlocked.

834
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,240
我们觉得这样对内莉比较好。
We thought it'd be nice for Nellie.

835
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,050
干得好，Solly。
Oh, good work, Solly.

836
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,210
把它放在草坪上。
Put it out on the lawn.

837
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,240
她在厕所…雕像旁边看起来不错。
She's loo... looking good by the statue.

838
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,870
雕像?
Statue?

839
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,730
听着，我们没有…
Look, we don't have...

840
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,730
将军在中央公园已经坐得够久了。
The general has been sitting in Central Park long enough.

841
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,700
我们觉得他需要换个环境。
We figure he needs a change of scenery.

842
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,230
你把那个将军放回马背上。
You take that general and put him back on his horse.

843
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,100
随你怎么说，小子。
Anything you say, Kid.

844
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,810
我们也觉得将军没了马一定很寂寞。
We, too, figured that general was lonesome without his horse.

845
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,730
他们可能还带了鸽子。
They probably brought the pigeons, too.

846
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,460
嘿，同花顺，帮帮他们?
Hey, Straight Flush, help them, huh?

847
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,590
你还以为我们带你来这里是为了拿免费报纸吗?
You still think we carried you out here To get free newspapers?

848
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:52,040
你做的…这是一家老人院，不是吗?
You did... it is an old folks' home, isn't it?

849
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,650
当然是。
Sure, it is.

850
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,670
最好的。
The best.

851
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,980
我们会让阳光之家的捕鼠器对我们的溢流感到满意。
We'll make that Sunshine Home rat Trap be satisfied with our overflow.

852
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,320
你做这一切都是为了我?
And you did all this for me?

853
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,870
原来你是百老汇最受欢迎的洋娃娃。
Turns out you're the most popular doll on Broadway.

854
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:06,350
街上每个骗子都在为你卖命。
Every chiseler on the street is knocking himself out for you.

855
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,360
孩子，我听说过这个地方的时候它还很开放。
Kid, I hear about this place when it was wide open.

856
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,300
但我从不进去。
But I'm never inside.

857
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,850
这是专门给肿胀用的。
It's strictly for swells.

858
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,920
不了。
Not anymore.

859
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,310
百老汇欢迎任何坏掉的旧娃娃。
Any broken down old doll on Broadway is welcome.

860
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,190
惊喜!

861
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,790
内莉，以防你需要朋友来玩金拉米或者垒球，我们买了很多旧娃娃。
Nellie, in case you're needing some friends To play gin rummy or maybe a game of softball, We loaded up on old dolls.

862

欢迎回家，内莉。
Welcome home, Nellie.

863
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,030

Brainey.

864
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,550
你还记得鲍姆加滕太太吗?

865
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,760
唱着Solly的岳母。

唱歌的索利捐了她。

867
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,510
是啊，她在这里会更开心。
Yeah, she'd be much happier here.

868
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,290
母亲住在他们的房子里，这对已婚夫妇总是很紧张。
It's always a strain on the married couple with the mother Living in their house.

869
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:53,140
但那是我的房子。
But it was my house.

870
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,580

哦，马上，阴郁。

873
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,350
带内莉见见姐妹会的其他成员，好吗?
See that Nellie meets the rest of the sorority, will you?

874
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,460
孩子，哦，太棒了。
Kid, oh, it's oh so wonderful.

875
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,570
我没什么好说的。
There's nothing I can say.

876
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,880
只是不知道该怎么说。
Just haven't got the words.

877
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,380
好。
Good.

00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,460
让我们保持这种状态。
Let's keep it that way.

879
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:07,960
不要说废话。
Say no yak-yak.

880
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:15,360
臭鼻子发现了这个漂亮的老太太住在桥下的小屋里。

我拥有她九年了。

那对一只鸟来说太老了。

在赌桌上放两块垫子。

是的，但我们还没告诉他们。

它们是摔跤垫。

915
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,170
你不会指望这些老女人睡在空荡荡的破桌子上吧?
You don't expect these old gals to sleep on bare crap tables?

916
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,990

嗯，我也困了。

这些袖子比我的胳膊长。

所以现代的。

930

床上吗?

00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,220
谁在乎呢?

00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,410
别一副跟驯鹿打交道的样子。
Now, don't look like you're handling hot reindeer.

1092
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:01,860
记住，这是合法的生意。
Remember, this is a legitimate business.

1093
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,200
我们有执照可以收钱。
We got a license to collect.

1094
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,870
现在，走出去，全身心地投入到工作中去，就像你做了一笔见不得光的交易。
Now, just get out there and put your heart Into you work, just like you would if it was a shady deal.

1095
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:07,370
嘿,小子。
Hey, Kid.

1096
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,530
那其他的圣诞老人呢?
What about them other Santas?

1097
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:11,580
是啊，街上到处都是又老又胖的家伙。
Yeah, the streets are lousy with jolly old, fat guys.

1098
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,810
我们要把子弹对准他们。
We'll put the slug on them.

1099
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:13,670
是的。

1100
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,590
哦，现在，等一下。
Oh, now, wait a minute.

1101
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:15,090
等一下。
Wait a minute.

1102
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:20,740
你不能随便拿其他圣诞老人开涮，尤其是在这个季节。
You can't go around putting the slug in other Santa Clauses, Especially at this time of the year when they're in season.

1103
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,880
现在，打开罐子，关上陷阱。
Now, keep your pots open and your traps shut.

1104
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,500
我们得弄到一万块钱。
We got to get ten grand.

1105
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,760
这是生死攸关的事
It's a matter of life and death.

1106
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:35,410
谁要是没拿到定额就把旧娃娃扔到雪地里，就我个人而言，这是在耍我。
Anybody who doesn't collect their quota Is throwing an old doll out into the snow, and personally, Doing me a very dirty trick.

1107
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:37,700
注意,男人。
Attention, men.

1108
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:43,790
调整靴子，腹部，胡须。

1109

现在，出去把你的罐子装上。

00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,800
叮叮当，叮叮当。
Jingle bells, jingle bells.

1112
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,880
一路叮当响。

1113
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,840
哦，坐在单马雪橇上多有趣啊。

一路叮当响……帮帮可怜的内莉吧，伙计们。
Jingle all the way... Help poor Nellie, folks.

1116
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,050
把它放进锅里。
Chunk it in the pot.

1117
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,030
是善良的。
Be kind.

1118
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,520
谢谢，亲爱的。
Oh, thanks, honey.

1119
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,510
谢谢。
Thanks.

1120
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:11,480
圣诞老人，平安夜你会来我家吗?
Santa, are you coming to my house Christmas Eve?

1121
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,020
当然，当然，小母马。

1122

圣诞老人将在那里平安夜。

1123

你会带娃娃来吗?

1124

不，我的娃娃在平安夜工作。

给老太太们一些东西。

为了善良的老太太，什么都可以。

给老太太们一些东西。

天啊，他太性感了!
Oh, man, is he hot!

1138
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:23,380
银铃，银铃。
Silver bells, silver bells.

1139
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:28,350
我们把娃娃放进猫里吧。
Let's put some doll in the kitty.

1140
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:33,800
把它塞进去。
Chunk it in.

1141
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:39,790
不然圣诞老人会给你米奇的。
Or Santy will give you a mickey.

1142
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:45,740
银铃，银铃……嗨，小子。
Silver bells, silver be... oh, hi, Kid.

1143
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,430
你好,Brainey。
Hello, Brainey.

1144
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,390
你好,悲观。
Hello, Gloomy.

1145
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,520
等一下。
Wait a minute.

1146
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,780
你不用搜我身。
You don't have to frisk me.

1147
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,330
我不会瞒着你的。
I ain't holding out on you.

1148
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,850
那些顾客只是不喜欢金币，仅此而已。
Them shoppers just ain't breaking Loose with the guineas, that's all.

1149
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,980
难怪他们不把它分块…你对他们咆哮的样子。
Well, no wonder they ain't chunking it In... the way you're growling at them.

1150
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,810
嗯，怎么了?
Well, what's the matter?

1151
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,100
是你叫我们唱歌的，对吧?
You told us to sing, didn't you?

1152
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,690
唱歌,是的。
Sing, yeah.

1153
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:04,390
但在圣诞节期间提到钱是庸俗的。
But to mention money at Christmastime is vulgar.

1154
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:06,120
你得努力打动他们的情绪。
You've got to work on their sentiments.

1155
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,910
要微妙、细腻。
Be subtle, delicate.

1156
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:21,360
银铃，银铃。
Silver bells, silver bells.

1157
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:30,740
现在是城里的圣诞节。
It's Christmastime in the city.

1158
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:37,740
铃声，听到他们的铃声。

1159
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:44,660
很快就到圣诞节了。
Soon it will be Christmas Day.

1160
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:51,930
城市的人行道，繁忙的人行道，穿着节日的风格。
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style.

1161
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:58,240
空气中弥漫着圣诞节的气氛。
In the air, there's a feeling of Christmas.

1162
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:05,160
孩子们在笑，人们在路过，相逢一个接一个的微笑。

现在是城里的圣诞节。

1169
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,670
Ring-a-ling。
Ring-a-ling.

1170
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:28,690
哦，玲，哦，玲，哦，玲。
Oh, ling, oh, ling, oh, ling.

1171
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:29,700
听他们的铃声。

1172
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,630
为了我和我的玛丽。

很快就到圣诞节了。

1174
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:44,270
圣诞节让你情绪激动。
Christmas makes you feel emotional.

1175
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:49,910
它可能带来党派或虔诚的思想。
It may bring parties or thoughts devotional.

1176
00:55:49,910 --> 00:56:04,730
无论发生什么或可能发生什么，这就是圣诞节对我的意义。
Whatever happens or what may be, Here is what Christmastime means to me.

1177
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,820
一串串的路灯。
Strings of streetlights.

1178
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:19,030
就连红绿灯都闪烁着明亮的红色和绿色，因为购物者带着他们的宝贝冲回家。
Even stoplights blink a bright red and green As the shoppers rush home with their treasures.

1179
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:23,260
听到雪的嘎吱声，看到孩子们。

城里的圣诞节到了。

我希望这是一辆雪橇。

找块骨头舔舔。

再见。

1203
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:02,130
这么说你是在妨碍演出?

1204
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:03,050
直到圣诞节。

1205
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:08,170
那小子任命我为首席医生照顾奈莉·星期四之家。
The Kid has appointed me head chief doctor To watch over the Nellie Thursday Home.

1206
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:11,370
那家伙到底有什么能耐让所有人都吓得跳起来?
What has that guy got that makes Everybody jump through a hoop?

1207
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:14,030
骗局越疯狂，跳得越高。
The crazier the schemes, the higher they jump.

1208
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,760
很多爱Nellie的人都不觉得这很疯狂。
A lot of people who love Nellie don't think it's so crazy.

1209
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,760
像你这样聪明的女孩，会放弃工作。
Smart girl, like you, gives up a job.

1210
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:24,500
街上每一个赌钱的人都在为你的老疯子捐钱。
Every penny ante character on the street Blows his top hustling donations for your old wacky.

1211
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,570
也许古怪。
Maybe wacky.

1212
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,150
但不是小赌注。
But not penny ante.

1213
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:27,930
这是个大生意。
This is big business.

1214
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:28,430
哈哈。
Ho-ho.

1215
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:31,590
为什么，你知道在四天内，我们筹集了将近2000美元吗?
Why, do you know that in four days, we raised almost $2,000?

1216
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:32,090
好吧。
All right.

1217
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:37,960
所以你收集…那些穿宽松裤子的圣诞老人筹了两千?
So you collect... those baggy-pants Santas Raised two grand?

1218
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,350
嗯嗯。
Mm-hm.

1219
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:43,760
你看那小子在这里。

1220
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,250
来，让我来。

1221
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,530
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1222
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:54,480
你知道吗，Brainey，当你回来的时候，你的工作就会等着你，这证明我在这里没有。
You know, Brainey, your job will be waiting for you when You come back, which proves that I haven't got it here.

1223
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,030
嘘，嘘，嘘。
Shh, shh, shh.

1224
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,910
头皮屑,嗯?
Dandruff, huh?

1225
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:41,730
准备好，你们这些野牛小弟，有印第安人来了。
Stand by, you Buffalo nickels, there's some Indians coming.

1226
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,150
合众为一。
E pluribus unum.

1227
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:45,850
嘘!
Shh!

1228
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:46,840
安静,令人陶醉。
Quiet, Heady.

1229
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,340
安静。
Quiet.

1230
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:56,080
给你的菠菜来点苦头。
Giving you your spinach the hard way.

1231
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,740
有趣的鼻子。
Funny nose.

1232
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,170
银铃，银铃。
Silver bells, silver bells.

1233
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:05,590
，战利品很不错。
, the loot is good.

1234
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,700
呃，是你。
Uh, it's you.

1235
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,740
我还以为是小偷呢。
I thought it was a prowler.

1236
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,240
小偷吗?
A prowler?

1237
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,270
有趣的事情。
Funny thing.

1238
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:22,450
我在给我爱的女孩唱小夜曲，她却认为我是个小偷。
Here I am serenading the girl I love, And she thinks I'm a prowler.

1239
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:23,940
嗯，我听到了一些声音。
Well, I heard some noise.

1240
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,680
但我不知道它在唱歌。
But I didn't know it was singing.

1241
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,580
我还没唱到副歌呢。
Uh, I didn't get to the chorus yet.

1242
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:31,690
我只是在这里观察天空，想着你。
I was just out here casing the sky, thinking of you.

1243
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:35,480
你知道吗，天上的每一颗星星都让我想起你眼中的光芒。
You know, every star up there reminds me Of the light in your eyes.

1244
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,650
一闪一闪，小…哦。
Twinkle, twinkle, little... uh-oh.

1245
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:42,270
闪烁,闪烁……那是小孩子的东西。
Twinkle, twinkle... That's kid stuff.

1246
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:43,890
亲爱的，你的尖牙露出来了。
Honey, your fangs are showing.

1247
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,750
如果你得意忘形了，不要克制自己，好吗?
If you get carried away, don't hold yourself back, ha?

1248
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,640
孩子。
Kid.

1249
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,310
亲爱的，永远不要失去我。
Honey, don't ever lose me.

1250
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:31,530
那会毁了你的。
It would ruin you.

1251
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,980
我们必须马上对柠檬滴小子施压。
We must lean in on the Lemon Drop Kid right away.

1252
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:42,040
嘿，你不会是想让我们穿上猴子装然后摇起铃铛吧?
Hey, you ain't figuring on us wearing the monkey suits And ringing them little bells?

1253
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:46,240
听着，如果那小子能在四天内筹到两千，我们能筹到更多。
Look, if the Kid can raise two grand in four days, We can raise lots more than that.

1254
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:46,850
当然,老板。
Sure, boss.

1255
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:48,850
孩子们在穆斯·莫兰的赌场里买了一堆旧娃娃。
The kids got a herd of old dolls in Moose Moran's casino.

1256
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:50,410
他就是这样拿到驾照的。
This is how he gets a license.

1257
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:51,810
我知道。
I know that.

1258
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:55,940
我知道执照上写的是给奈莉·星期四之家的。
I know that the license is made out To the Nellie Thursday Home.

1259
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:02,550
所以我想无论内莉·星期四在哪，那就是内莉·星期四之家，明白吗?
So I figured that wherever Nellie Thursday is, That's the Nellie Thursday Home, you see?

1260
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:03,820
现在，我们要做的是。
Now, here's what we're going to do.

1261
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:10,930
看,女孩。
Look, girls.

1262
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:12,440
先生们要来拜访了。
Gentlemen are coming to call.

1263
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,970
哦，他们给我们带了花!
Oh, and they're bringing us flowers!

1264
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,900
它们必须是有价值的。
They must be valuable.

1265
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,600
他们用枪保护他们。
They're guarding them with a gun.

1266
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,570
把那东西拿开。
Put that thing away.

1267
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,490
你觉得这些旧娃娃会拿杆子吗?
You think these old dolls carry rods?

1268
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:24,360
你看不出来。
You can't tell.

1269
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,580
那个安妮·奥克利女士呢?
What about that Annie Oakley dame?

1270
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:28,190
把它收起来，你…好吧。
Put that away, you... All right.

1271
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:33,990
好了，别忘了。
All right, now, don't forget.

1272
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:37,100
帽子和"请"和"女士"都要去掉
It's off with the hat and "please" and "ma'am."

1273
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,190
明白了吗?
You got it?

1274
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,410
强尼，你待在这里。
Johnny, you stay here.

1275
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:41,970
祝福你，善良的先生。
Bless you, kind sir.

1276
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:42,470
保佑你。

1277
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:44,480
又一天，又一美元，更少的税。
Another day, another dollar, less taxes.

1278
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,160
谢谢你，女士。

1279
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,070

01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,850

01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:56,910
哈哈!

Oh, I'm sorry, the post is... sorry, Your money is just spread out all over.

让我来帮你。
Let me help you with it.

1288
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:05,410
找钱给你。
You get the change.

1289
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:06,650
呵呵，呵呵，呵呵。
Ho-ho, ho, ho.

1290
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:07,880
对不起,先生。

01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,470
你在这儿。

01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:11,300
先生，往锅里放点东西。
Put something in the pot, sir.

1293
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,630
锅里有东西。

1294
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:13,970
圣诞节的礼物。
Something for Christmas.

圣诞快乐。
Merry Christmas.

1300
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:23,860
咩……女士，你要为不幸的人做点什么。
Meh... you do, ma'am, something for the less fortunate.

1301
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,840
恐怕我没有零钱。
I'm afraid I haven't any change.

1302
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,920
哦，没关系。

我来处理。

01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:33,920
我可没想过全部拿走。

1305
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,390
圣诞快乐。

1306
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:40,340
快乐……你好,威利。
Merry... hello, Willie.

1307
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,540
你怎么认识我的?
How do you know me?

1308
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:43,430
圣诞老人无所不知。
Santa Claus knows everything.

1309
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:46,890
圣诞老人知道是谁抢劫了圣乔的盒子工厂。
Santa knows who knocked off that box factory at St. Joe.

1310
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:49,940

Santa even knows about Willie going In to case the bank setup.

1311
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,270
最好在水壶里放点东西。
Better put something in the kettle.

1312
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:58,070
怎么，你…如果威利没有在水壶里放点东西，圣诞老人就会停止敲钟，开始为舞蹈者、腾空者和扁平足者吹口哨。
Why, you, uh... If Willie doesn't put something in the kettle, Santa will stop ringing the bell and start Blowing the whistle for Dancer, Prancer, and Flatfoot.

1313
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,800
圣诞快乐。
Merry Christmas.

1314
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,750
呃，呃，呃，呃，呃。
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:13,200
嗬，嗬，嗬，嗬，嗬。
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1320
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:25,680
在风大的角落辛苦了一天后，没有什么比回家更好的了。
Oh, there's nothing like coming home After a hard day in a windy corner.

1321
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,590
当然，你要和布雷尼共进晚餐。
Sure, you're going to have dinner with Brainey.

1322
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:30,680
而我，却和一些熟透的海报女郎在一起。
Me, I end up with some of them overripe pin-up girls.

1323
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,440
我本可以去华尔道夫的。
I could have gone to the Waldorf.

1324
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:32,940
华尔道夫酒店吗?
The Waldorf?

1325
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,880
你怎么敢?
How dare you?

1326
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,650
不要不诚实。
Don't be dishonest.

1327
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:36,540
这笔钱是内莉·星期四之家的。
This money belongs to the Nellie Thursday Home.

1328
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,270
嗯?
Huh?

1329
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:39,340
但是标志在哪里呢?
But where is the sign?

1330
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,320
哦，我想是周二洗漱日。
Oh, Tuesday wash day, I guess.

1331
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,800
嘿，门开着。
Hey, the door is open.

1332
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,990
可能晚上出去打马球了。
Probably out playing night polo.

1333
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,880
当你第一次按下按钮时，并没有什么东西从墙上射出来。
First time you pressed the button, And something didn't come shooting out of the wall.

1334
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,220
嘿，那是什么?
Hey, what's that?

1335
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,000
它只是一头牛。
It's just a cow.

1336
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,460
牛在房子里做什么?
What's a cow doing inside a house?

1337
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,840
米尔顿·伯利今晚上演。
Milton Berle is on tonight.

1338
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:04,970
Brainey吗?

1340
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,580
大家都去哪儿了?

1341
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:11,130
是啊，很好，在辛苦为他们攒钱之后。
Yeah, fine welcome after knocking ourselves Out collecting that dough for them.

1342

哦，他们一定在附近……面团!
Oh, they must be around... the dough!

1343

当然，你拿着它。

1345
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:24,970
不,不。

我把它们藏在这里了。

我以为除了我没人知道。

1349
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:35,920
嗯…除了我没有别人，是吗?
Uh... No one but me, huh?

1350
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,370
牛津查理。
An Oxford Charlie.

1351
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:39,700
还有谁会戴定制的14 AAAA?
Who else wears a custom-made 14 AAAA?

1352
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,720
走吧，我们要去查理在尼亚克的家。
Come on, we're going to Charlie's place in Nyack.

1353
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:43,440

1354
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,340
冰箱里有牛奶。

1355
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:44,990
进屋去。

1356
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:46,020
你想感冒吗?
You want to catch cold?

1357
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:00,440
你觉得那些小盗窃犯怎么样?
How do you like those petty larceny crooks?

1358
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,530
他们甚至偷了我们的招牌。
They even stole our sign.

1359
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,080
天啊，真是个惊喜派对。
Boy, what a surprise party.

1360
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,350
他们不会料到我们会来。
They'll never expect us.

1361
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:11,370
请进，先生们。
Come in, gentlemen.

1362
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:12,290
我在等你。
You were expected.

1363
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:13,850
是的。
Yeah.

1364
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:16,660
是的，我知道。
Yeah, I know.

1365
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:17,630
是的。
Yeah.

1366
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:20,440
是啊，他来找我要钱的时候我也是这么想的。
Yeah, that's what I figure when he comes to me for the money.

1367
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,500
听着，你能稍等一下吗?
Look, do you mind holding on for a minute?

1368
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,970
不，我不急。
No, I'm in no hurry.

1369
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:26,510
好的，我稍等。
Yeah, I'll hold on.

1370
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,750
好吧,孩子。
Well, Kid.

1371
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:29,980
很高兴见到你。
Well, it's nice to see you.

1372
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,650
你要什么?
What'll it be?

1373
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:31,790
波旁威士忌,苏格兰威士忌吗?
Bourbon, scotch?

1374
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:33,820
把我们的老女人都倒出来，快点儿。
Just pour out our old ladies and make it snappy.

1375
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,990
啊，别紧张。
Ah, take it easy.

1376
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:38,650
楼上的女士们在真正的床上非常开心。
The ladies are perfectly happy upstairs in real beds.

1377
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:40,500
孩子，救救我们。
Kid, Save us.

1378
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,780
我们的囚犯!
We're prisoners!

1379
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:46,940
菲尼太太想报警，他们打了她的假牙。
Mrs. Feeney tried to call the police, And they hit her false teeth.

1380
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:47,880
孩子!
Kid!

1381
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,850
哦，我们去拿东西。
Oh, we'll get our things.

1382
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:50,000
我们马上下来。
We'll be right down.

1383
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,380
是的，快点。
Yeah, hurry up.

1384
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,720
你知道的，小子。
You know, Kid.

1385
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,910
你真是个天才。
You're a genius.

1386
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:57,700
我以前还以为你是个小骗子呢。
Just to think that I used to have you Figured for a small-time chiseler.

1387
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:01,110
而你却把百老汇所有的骗子都变成了马戏团。
And here you are making a circus out of all the con men On Broadway.

1388
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:03,350
你从哪弄来的那玩意儿?
Where do you get that sucker stuff?

1389
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:07,320
我们不会因为他在圣诞节坦诚相待就想骗他。
We don't figure a chance to sucker Just because he gets honest at Christmastime.

1390
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,360
不，别转移话题。
No, don't change the subject.

1391
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,880
我们是来找老女人的。
We're here for the old gals.

1392
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:18,320
我说你们是世界上最大的傻瓜，因为你们在为奈莉·星期四之家募捐，每一分钱都进了那孩子的口袋。
I say you're the biggest suckers In the world because here you are, out collecting money For the Nellie Thursday Home, and every cent goes right Into the Kid's pocket.

1393
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,920
真不敢相信!
I don't believe it!

1394
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,190
我们也不知道。
We don't either.

1395
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:25,160
我也是，你不能相信牛津·查理这样的人。
Neither do I. You just can't trust A character like Oxford Charlie.

1396
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,480
同花顺，你以前为穆斯·莫兰工作。
Straight Flush, you used to work for Moose Moran.

1397
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,380
我正在佛罗里达和慕斯通话。
I've got Moose on the phone now in Florida.

1398
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,150
问问他为什么那小子要收一万美元。
Ask him why the Kid is collecting ten grand.

1399
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:34,570
我会问他的。
I'll ask him.

1400
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:35,720
喂?
Hello?

1401
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,060
你是哪位?
Who is this?

1402
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:37,920
打错了。
Wrong number.

1403
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,080
来，给我!
Here, give me that!

1404
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,060
别担心，小子。
Don't worry, Kid.

1405
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,970
我们支持你。
We're with you.

1406
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:43,760
你好,麋鹿。
Hello, Moose.

1407
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,870
这是同花顺。
This is Straight Flush.

1408
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:50,560
牛津查理想告诉我们"柠檬小子"是个不诚实的人。
Oxford Charlie's trying to tell us The Lemon Drop Kid is something less than on the level.

1409
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,010
是吗?
Yeah?

1410
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:54,900
嗯。
Hm.

1411
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,990
我想我们是世界上最大的傻瓜了。
I guess we are the biggest suckers in the whole world.

1412
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,730
我以为那小子是我的朋友。
I thought the Kid was my friend.

1413
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:04,740
我就站在街角，穿着矫揉造作的衣服，摇着我的小铃铛。
And there I am, standing on the corner, wearing a hokey suit, And ringing my little bell.

1414
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,170
嘿，那小子怎么了?
Hey, what happened to the Kid?

1415
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,500
我知道他会怎么样。
I know what's going to happen to him.

1416
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,230
我们去找他。
Let's find him.

1417
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:09,260
现在，等一下。
Now, wait a minute.

1418
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:09,920
等一下。
Wait a minute.

1419
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,120
忘了那小子吧。
Forget about the Kid.

1420
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,970
穆斯·莫兰会照顾他的。
Moose Moran will take care of him.

1421
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:15,260
从现在起，你们为我工作。
From now on, you guys are working for me.

1422
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:18,230
我们会从这笔生意中赚到每一分钱。
We'll squeeze every dime out of this racket.

1423
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:20,680
每个人都有很大的分成。
And there'll be a big fat cut for everybody.

1424
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:29,080
孩子!
Kid!

1425
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,300
孩子，我觉得你是世上最卑微的…现在,Brainey。
Kid, I think that you are the lowest thing... Now, Brainey.

1426
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,440
不要急于下结论。
Don't jump to conclusions.

1427
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,460
我可以解释一切。
I can explain everything.

1428
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,910
从我第一次见到你，你就一直在解释肮脏的把戏。
You've been explaining dirty tricks Since the first time I met you.

1429
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:36,880
我得筹集一万美元。
Well, I had to raise ten grand.

1430
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,340
你想让我被杀吗?
Did you want me to get killed?

1431
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:40,390
这是你想到的最好的主意!
That's the best idea you ever had!

1432
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:44,800
你怎么能这么卑鄙到…我不知道那些老娃娃会这么受欢迎。
How can you be so low as to, uh... I didn't realize the old dolls would take it so big.

1433
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,170
至少，他们还会有回报。
At least, they're going to be around for the payoff.

1434
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:50,890
在平安夜，慕斯·莫兰会给我打上"付清"的标记
On Christmas Eve, Moose Moran is going To mark me "paid in full."

1435
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:53,030
那是八天假。
That's eight days off.

1436
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:54,000
你想让我怎么做?
What do you expect me to do?

1437
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,370
从牛津·查理这样的流氓那里偷钱?
Steal the money back from a hoodlum like Oxford Charlie?

1438
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:57,230
为什么不呢?
Why not?

1439
01:08:57,230 --> 01:09:02,390
至少百老汇会有人为你流泪。
Then at least, somebody around Broadway Might shed a tear for you.

1440
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:03,710
我再也不会这么做了。
That's more than I'll ever do again.

1441
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:41,560
这个戒指多少钱?
How much on this ring?

1442
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,190
你的结婚戒指?
Your wedding ring?

1443
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:48,220
很抱歉，内莉，我的婚戒太多了。
I'm sorry, Nellie, but I'm loaded up with wedding rings.

1444
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,940
哦,鲁珀特。
Oh, Rupert.

1445
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,130
你得给我点线索。
You got to give me something on it.

1446
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:59,830
是为今晚的家庭聚会准备的。
It's for, uh, well, tonight's sort of a family reunion.

1447
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:01,230
好的。
OK.

1448
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:01,730
把它脱下来。
Take it off.

1449
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:02,410
我来看看。
I'll have a look.

1450
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:10,540
很久没戒了。
Haven't had it off a long time.

1451
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:19,790
你们女人总是匆匆忙忙的。
You women are always in such a rush.

1452
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:20,790
你想做什么?
What are you trying to do?

1453
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:21,690
抢劫她的珠宝?
Heist her jewelry?

1454
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,590
孩子，我的麻烦够多了。
Kid, I got enough trouble.

1455
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,630
你现在想从我这里得到什么?
What do you want from me now?

1456
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:38,840
听着，内莉，一群好人为你筹了很多钱。
Look, Nellie, a bunch of swell guys collected a lot of money For you.

1457
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:44,240
我不会让一个骗子，一个骗子，和一个面包屑把事情搞糟。
I'm not going to let a cheat, chiseler, And a crumb gum up the worse.

1458
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,680
你是说牛津查理吧。
You mean Oxford Charlie.

1459
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,470
谁?
Who?

1460
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:49,930
是的。
Yeah.

1461
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:51,250
你是怎么从他家逃出来的?
Say, how did you get out of his place?

1462
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,840
其他的娃娃和布雷尼呢?
Where are the other dolls and Brainey?

1463
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,210
还在尼亚克。
Still in Nyack.

1464
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:56,740
我等待机会，然后偷偷溜了出去。
I waited for my chance, and then I sneaked out.

1465
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,860
好吧，如果你能溜出去，我也能溜进去。
Yeah, well, if you can sneak out, I can sneak in.

1466
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,930
我要去拿那些属于你和其他旧娃娃的钱。
I'm going to get that money that belongs To you and the other old dolls.

1467
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:02,960
孩子，别试。
Kid, don't try it.

1468
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,560
你不会成功的。
You'll never make it.

1469
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,830
查理那儿到处都是警卫。
Why, Charlie's got guards all over there.

1470
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,180
和他……看，看，内莉。

1471
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:08,850
我有一个角度。
I've got an angle.

1472
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:10,660
现在，再听我说一次。

1473
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,170
我要你把所有男孩都召集起来。
I want you to round up all the boys.

1474
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:13,370
带他们去法院。
Take them to the courthouse.

1475
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:14,210
联系一下法官。
Get a hold of the judge.

1476
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:14,870
和…
And...

1477
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,080
一步……别挡我的路!
Step... get out of my way!

1478
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,070
你好,首席。

一共95美分。
That'll be 95 cents.

1480
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,880
哦,是的。

1481
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:38,380
95美分和1美元给你自己。

1482
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:39,150
哦，不，妈妈。
Oh, no, mother.

1483
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:40,730
你不用给我小费。
You don't have to tip me.

1484
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:41,770
真的吗?
Really?

1485
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,440
嗯,在这里。
Well, here.

1486
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,260
来支雪茄。
Have a cigar.

1487
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,400
梦想不需要花费一分钱。
It doesn't cost a dime to dream.

1488
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,890
我们会在墙上挂满美钞。
We'll line our walls with dollar bills.

1489
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,360
是吗?
Yeah?

1490
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,460
我是个没饭吃的可怜老太太，好心的先生。
I'm a poor old lady who haven't got to eat, Kind sir.

1491
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:22,700
我听说这是一个老太太的家…当然了。
And I heard this was an old lady's home... Sure it is.

1492
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,850
但我们的耳朵都在老娃娃的嘴里了。
But we're up to our ears in old dolls' mouths.

1493
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:27,570
但我无处可去。
Oh, but I have no place to go.

1494
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:31,660
我这辈子都得省吃俭用来养孩子。
All my life, I've had to scrimp and save To support my children.

1495
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:37,220
我日复一日地在火炉上做饭，一直缝到眼睛发麻。
I've sewed till my eyes burned, cooked over a hot stove day After day.

1496
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,840
我甚至还得把地板拿去洗。
I even have to take in floors to wash.

1497
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,870
对不起，老娃娃。
Sorry, old doll.

1498
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:41,520
不行。
No dice.

1499
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,020
哦，拜托，先生。
Oh, please, sir.

1500
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:47,070
如果你把我拒之门外，我将无处可去，只能去找当局。
If you turn me away, I'll have no place To go except to the authorities.

1501
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:48,630
呃，等等，女士。
Eh, uh, hold it, ma'am.

1502
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:49,250
嗯，请进。
Eh, come right in.

1503
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,300
我会跟老板说的。
I'll talk to the boss.

1504
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:54,520
既然你是个没饭吃的可怜老太太，也许他会改变我的想法。
Seeing as you're a poor old lady who hasn't got to eat, Maybe he'll change my mind.

1505
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,160
在这儿等着，我为你美言几句。

1506
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:56,760

1507
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:02,540
嗯嗯。
Mm-hm.

1508
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:12,090
那是个老太太?
That's an old lady?

1509
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:14,090
头儿，她又想从窗户逃出去了。
Boss, she was trying to get out the window again.

1510
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:14,820
内莉的消失了。
Nellie's disappeared.

1511
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,170
必须有人找到她。
And somebody's got to find her.

1512
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:21,000
布雷尼，我警告过你要守规矩，否则我就要让孩子们…我会想尽一切办法离开这里。
Brainey, I warned you to stay in line, Or I'm going to have the boys... I'll get out of here any way I can.

1513
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:21,860
那好吧。
All right then.

1514
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:23,440
带她回房间去。
Take her back to her room.

1515
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,190
跟着她，直到把他们都搬走为止。
And stick with her until it's time to move them all out.

1516
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:28,720
外面那个新的旧娃娃呢?
And what about the new old doll outside?

1517
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:32,050
好吧，再喝几小时也无妨。
Well, one more for a couple of hours won't hurt anything.

1518
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:33,610
而且，我们不能让她去报警。
Besides, we can't have her going to the police.

1519
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:34,490
好吧，带她进来。
All right, show her in.

1520
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,780
这就是她，老板。

1521
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,030
太太比斯利。

1522
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:53,150
赫伯特·比斯利夫人。

See, the other girls are just going to stay in this house Until Christmastime.

1526
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:04,040
然后他们搬到一个真正的豪宅。
Then they move to a real mansion.

1527
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,250
大得像赌场。
Big as a casino.

1528
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:07,550
哦，听起来太棒了!
Oh, that sounds wonderful!

1529
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:09,400
这意味着你接受我为客人了吗?
Does it mean that you accept me as a guest?

1530
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,090
嗯嗯。

1531
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:13,410
我高兴得都想哭了。
Oh, I'm so happy, I could cry.

1532
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:14,210
好吧，好吧。
All right, all right.

1533
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:14,710
这是……
That's...

01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:22,200
-我的药。-我的药。

你拿错包了。

1544
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,230
哦，我的天哪!

1545

笨拙的我。
Clumsy me.

很重，不是吗?

1548
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:42,640
你在用什么编织?
What are you knitting with?

1549
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:43,260
钢丝绒?
Steel wool?

1550
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:44,250
嗯。
Hm.

1551
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:54,360
如果我能买得起新眼镜，我就…梦想不需要花费一分钱……

1563
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,070
监狱吗?

1564
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:37,440
亲爱的我!

01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,840
但是典狱长……呃，那个主管看起来是个不错的人。
But the warden... uh, the superintendent Seem like such a nice one.

1566
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,270
那不是主管。
That's not the superintendent.

1567
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:44,400
他是牛津查理，那个敲诈犯。
He's Oxford Charlie, the racketeer.

1568
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,330

1571
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:55,540
亲爱的，你在忙什么呢?

在Gen之后。
Uh, after Gen.

1574
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:07,610
卡斯特被杀了，比斯利先生坚持要我一直带着他的手枪。
Custer was massacred, Mr. Beasley Insisted I carry his pistol at all times.

1575
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:08,790

讨厌的红人队。

1578
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:14,780
你到底在织什么?

到处都找不到。
Hard to get them anywhere.

1581
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:24,000
它们和我的阿盖尔磨砂桶很搭。
And they go so well with my Argyle scrub bucket.

1582
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:34,610
你不觉得大一点的腰带，在我们这个年纪会更明智吗?
Eh, don't you think a larger sized girdle would, uh, Be much more sensible at our age?

1583
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:35,880
我把它拿得很小。
I take it small.

1584
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,490
总是有。
Always have.

1585
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:41,010
亲爱的比斯利先生，他为我沙漏般的身材感到骄傲。
Dear Mr. Beasley, he was so proud of my hourglass figure.

1586
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:43,350
亲爱的，你的身材还是那么沙漏。
You still have your hourglass figure, dear.

1587

但是大部分沙子都沉到了海底。

这太离谱了!

01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,390
那是一次短暂的拜访，不是吗?
That was a short visit, wasn't it?

1597
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:02,960

你知道你在干什么吗?

我以为你们这些漂亮的旧娃娃都没了。

01:27:56,660 --> 01:27:57,970
内莉，成功了。
Nellie, it worked.

1777
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:03,440
好吗?
Well?

1778
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:03,940
内莉!
Nellie!

1779
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:06,300
你丈夫，亨利，他要来了。
Your husband, Henry, he's a-coming.

1780
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,830
他只是从雕像旁边经过!
He's a-just a-passing the statue!

1781
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:09,210
哦，嗬嗬，就是这个了，各位!
Oh, ho-ho, this is it, everybody!

1782
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:10,940
古巴，把开关拉开，把桌子搬走。
Goomba, pull the switches and get rid of the tables.

1783
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:11,880
-是的。-来吧。
- Yeah. - Come on.

1784
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:11,920
-是的。-来吧。布雷尼，别走开。
- Yeah. - Come on. Brainey, don't go away.

1785
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:12,650
布雷尼，别走开。
Brainey, don't go away.

1786
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:13,460
我想和你谈谈。
I want to talk to you.

1787
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:23,260
内莉。
Nellie.

1788
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:29,090
欢迎回家，亨利。
Welcome home, Henry.

1789
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:31,180
哦。
Aw.

1790
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,660
你看起来很漂亮，内莉。
You look very pretty, Nellie.

1791
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:35,300
很高兴见到你，亨利。
It's nice to see you, Henry.

1792
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:37,100
亨利，这是柠檬小子。
Henry, this is the Lemon Drop Kid.

1793
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:38,920
他要为这一切负责。
He's responsible for all this.

1794
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:39,570
谢谢你,孩子。
Thanks, Kid.

1795
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:40,520
哦，这是可扣除的。
Oh, it's deductible.

1796
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,310
进来吧，汉克。
Come on in, Hank.

1797
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:52,680
这是我们的贵宾，亨利·里根夫妇。
Here's our guests of honor, Mr. And Mrs. Henry Regan.

1798
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:56,680
快12点了。
It's almost 12 o'clock.

1799
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,010
该上冰淇淋了。
Time to serve the ice cream.

1800
01:28:58,010 --> 01:28:59,650
我去拿餐巾纸和盘子。
I'll get the napkins and the dishes.

1801
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:00,860
你真棒。
Goody for you.

1802
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:01,820
这是你的派对，内莉。
It's your party, Nellie.

1803
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:03,110
过来切蛋糕。
Come and cut the cake.

1804
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:04,590
银器在哪里?
Where is the silverware?

1805
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:06,520
外科医生山姆说它在保险箱里。
Sam the Surgeon said it was in the safe.

1806
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,760
我们怎么把它弄出来?
How do we get it out?

1807
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,520
从保险柜里出来?
Out of the safe?

1808
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,280
是啊，我们怎么把它从保险箱里拿出来?
Yeah, how do we get it out of the safe?

1809
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,270
保险箱里。
The safe.

1810
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:22,200
哦,不。
Oh, no.

1811
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,080
不是我。
Not me.

1812
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,650
但这是内奸，亨利。
But it's an inside job, Henry.

1813
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:25,850
什么是非法的。
Nothing illegal.

1814
01:29:25,850 --> 01:29:27,270
算是客人拍的。
Sort of a guest shot.

1815
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:29,510
我刚因为非法开锁坐了二十年牢。
I just did twenty years for safe cracking.

1816
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:31,420
所以没有银制餐具我们就不能供应冰淇淋。
So we can't serve the ice cream without the silverware.

1817
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:33,180
这一切都是为了纪念你。
And the whole thing is in your honor.

1818
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:35,040
再说了，你也不能突然停止。
Besides, you can't stop all of a sudden.

1819
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,080
你必须逐渐减少。
You have to taper off.

1820
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:42,290
好吧，我得带上我的纪念品。
Well, uh, I'll have to take my keepsakes with me.

1821
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:43,680
哦，东西在这儿，哈?
Oh, the stuff is here, ha?

1822
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:46,690
美妙的,亨利。
Wonderful, Henry.

1823
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:49,570
祝你好运。
Good luck.

1824
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:51,010
对不起，内莉。
Excuse me a minute, Nellie.

1825
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:56,250
你现在在忙什么?
What are you up to now?

1826
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:57,730
我在这里，你在那里。
Oh, I'm up to here, you're up to there.

1827
01:29:57,730 --> 01:29:58,960
多好的赌注啊?
What a parlay, huh?

1828
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,140
拿着电话。
Hold the phone.

1829
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,490
你眼睛里有固定种族的表情。
You've got that fixed race look in your eye.

1830
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:03,850
你不觉得这很可爱吗?
Don't you see that's lovely?

1831
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:05,970
天啊，我可以自由结婚了。
God, I'm free to get married.

1832
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:08,890
可怜的小娃娃，你等了太久了。
Oh, you poor little doll, you've been waiting so long.

1833
01:30:08,890 --> 01:30:10,520
但对你来说是值得的。
But it was worth it to you.

1834
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,380
现在，你难倒我了。
Now, you got me.

1835
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:13,310
但是我们负担不起。
But we can't afford it.

1836
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:14,530
我最近没有工作。
I haven't been working lately.

1837
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:15,150
放松。
Relax.

1838
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:16,360
我都计划好了。
I have everything planned.

1839
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:41,070
但是我们要用什么来赚钱呢?
But what are we going to use for money?

1840
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:43,010
别担心，亲爱的。
Don't worry, honey.

1841
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:44,350
我要把银器当掉。
I'll hock the silverware.

1842
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,490
安静,Crosby
Quiet, Crosby.
